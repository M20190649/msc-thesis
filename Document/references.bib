abstract = {Free-floating bike sharing systems are an emerging new generation of bike rentals, that eliminates the need for specific stations and allows to leave a bicycle (almost) everywhere in the network. Although free-floating bikes allow much greater spontaneity and flexibility for the user, they need additional operational challenges especially in facing the bike relocation process. Then, we suggest a methodology able to generate spatio-temporal clusters of the usage patterns of the available bikes in every zone of the city, forecast the bicycles use trend (by means of Non-linear Autoregressive Neural Networks) for each cluster, and consequently enhance and simplify the relocation process in the network.},

abstract = {We propose a test of the null hypothesis that an observable series is stationary around a deterministic trend. The series is expressed as the sum of deterministic trend, random walk, and stationary error, and the test is the LM test of the hypothesis that the random walk has zero variance. The asymptotic distribution of the statistic is derived under the null and under the alternative that the series is difference-stationary. Finite sample size and power are considered in a Monte Carlo experiment. The test is applied to the Nelson-Plosser data, and for many of these series the hypothesis of trend stationarity cannot be rejected.},
